\begin{abstract}
This summer I have read many papers about epithelial tissue modeling, taken an online course in the CUDA programming langauge and become a proficient Python programmer, read the CHASTE source code, and worked through the CHASTE tutorials. I have a solid knowledge of a variety of epithelial tissue models, ability to work the leading modeling software, and a high level of proficiency in two languages which will be instruental in producing my own model.
