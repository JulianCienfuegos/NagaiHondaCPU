\chapter{Why Study Epithelial Tissue?}
And what is epithelial tissue, anyway? Epithelial tissue is the most prolific of the four types of tissue in the human body. The tissue covers  the whole body, inside and out, as it is specialized to form the covering of internal and external surfaces. 
It is important to study this tissue as an intellectual activity in and of itself, but more importantly because once its behavior is understood coomputational models will become useful tools for biomedical research and animal-free experimentation.
My primary interest in this modeling is because it offers an obviously parallel programming task and also because it promisesto enable medical researchers to run computational simulations where once  they had to perfrom animal experiments.
